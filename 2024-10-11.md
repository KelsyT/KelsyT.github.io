Sol, Neptue, Commercial, 77th year, Revision 6.

Norman builds and repairs commercial Burros, the spacefaring cargo ships that connect mankind's colonies. Few people truly appreciate the vast quantites of goods and data these carry between worlds. Burros often deliver to war torn ports defended by the swift Empire Prowlers.

As Norman is performing a routine visual inspection of a Burro (Ever Floating, call sign SNC776) due for scheduled maintenance, he finds something strange that he later realizes is evidence of the resistance group Drosera having taken control of the ship before being neutralized by Empire forces.
