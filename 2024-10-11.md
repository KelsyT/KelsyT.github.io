Sol, Neptue, Commercial, 77th year, Revision 6.

Norman builds and repairs ship data carriages. These ships carry enourmous quantites of goods and data between worlds. The ships deliver to war torn ports defended by Empire destroyers. As Norman is performing a routine visual inspection of a frigate (Ever Floating, call sign SNC776) due for scheduled maintence, he finds something hidden within that shocks him, forcing him to re-evaluate his loyalty to the King. Norman is forced to destroy the evidence before word gets out about it.

Norman, having chosen loyalty to his King over his own virtues of honesty begins to grow cynical. When another frigate

Charles conducts forensic investigations of wrecks that have been salvaged from the warzone. Charles is showing a consultant the process of putting the peices of the frigate back together with the intent on improving the inventory system. There are thousands of peices to take into account, so anything that save Charles time is deeply apprecited. There are many wrecks for him to investigate after all. This recent one doesn't make sense though.
