 Norman builds and repairs ships, massive frigates for transporting goods between worlds. The frigates deliver to war torn ports defended by Empire destroyers. As Norman is performing a routine visual inspection of a frigate due for scheduled maintence, he finds something hidden within that shocks him, forcing him to re-evaluate 

Charles conducts forensic investigations of wrecks that have been salvaged from the warzone. Charles is showing a consultant the process of putting the peices of the frigate back together with the intent on improving the inventory system. There are thousands of peices to take into account, so anything that save Charles time is deeply apprecited. There are many wrecks for him to investigate after all. This recent one doesn't make sense though.
