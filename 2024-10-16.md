Norman zipped up his yellow jumper, landed feet first into an EVA suit and closed his eyes as he savored one last breath. *It'll be 72 hours until I get back to fresh air.* As his lungs filled, the opening along his spine began to seal, slicone creeping it's way up along his spine and finally locking with a tickle at the nape of his neck. *Sometimes the seals didn't want to come undone.* As his breath continued, the suit weighed down on him, closing in around him. Raising his right hand, he slapped on his air pump. The suit relaxed outward. Norman finally exhaled and opened his eyes.

*Damned wardrobe always was too bright.* He brought his hand up to sheild his eyes but the light was too diffused. Alongside him were several other EVA suits strapped to the worn octagonal walls of the crampt cabin. He swang open the door in front and used hand holds to climb through the opening into the airlock. Norman swiped his keycard along the scanner, flicked a button labled with a checkmark, and after a short delay, the steel door behind him slammed closed as the airlock began to depressurize. He wedged his boots into the foot rungs and felt his feet squeze against the bottom of his socks. They were already wet with sweat.

A siren began shouting and Norman could feel the pressure on his body lifting away. *It was easier the first time, calmer. I swear the suits are getting heavier.* His shoulders were relieved, then he felt a wave of vertigo mixed with dread. The white chamber lights flickered and then switched to a yellow devoid of warmth. The air seemed to hiss as it scurried away. and the lights turned from white to yellow. The sound of the siren was abruptly sliced, and then there was silence.
