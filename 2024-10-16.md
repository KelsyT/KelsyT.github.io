Norman zipped up his yellow jumper, landed feet first into an E.V.A. suit and shut his eyes as he savored one last breath. *72 hours till I get back to this stinking air I seem to love.* As his lungs filled, the suit began to seal along his spine, slicone creeping it's way up until it locked with a tickle at the nape of his neck. *Sometimes the seals didn't want to come undone.* As he continued inhaling, the suit depressed, closing in around him. Raising his right hand, he slapped on his air pump. The suit relaxed outward. Norman finally exhaled and opened his eyes.

*I swear these suits are getting heavier. But this damned wardrobe always was too bright.* He brought his hand up to sheild his eyes but the light was too diffused. Alongside him were several other E.V.A. suits strapped to the worn octagonal walls of the crampt cabin. He swang open the door he faced and used hand holds to climb through the opening into the airlock. Norman swiped his keycard along the scanner, flicked the lock button, and after a short delay, the steel door behind him slammed closed as the airlock began to depressurize, rattling the room. He wedged his boots into the foot rungs and felt his feet squeze against the bottom of his wet socks. *Why's it so hot?*

The siren began shouting and Norman could feel the pressure on his body lifting away. *Mag's expecting the carriage to be unloaded today. I do a favor for him last week and now he thinks I can cut through red tape with every Burro!* The air seemed to hiss as it was sent off. The pulsing lights turned from white to yellow. The siren halted abruptly, first becoming an echo and then disappered, leaving only silence.

Norman still heard ringing though. *God I hate when it's quiet.*

The airlock had remained the same, but now Norman found himself light within the vacuum of space. Microgravity let him push off the floor of the airlock, floating towards the ceiling. He grabbed hold and then sent himself towards the door that led to the ship yard. Holding on to the wall with one hand and swinging the exit door open with the other, he found his eyes drawn to his latest assingment, the USS Ever Floating. *Where have I seen you before?* 

 He pulled out his warning flag and pushed off the exterior wall of the airlock towards the Burro. As he drifted through the yard he saw other technicians pushing and pulling themselves around other ships like pinballs. Most were due for maintanence, somtimes needing cosmetic repairs, and other times complete overhauls. As long as Smile would pay, the contractors working on Neptune Nine would perform diligent, quick work. *We always work our asses off but never get a break.* 
 
 Norman approached the Burro's starboard side. He pulled out his grapple hook, swung it in hoops and then hurled it towards a rung closer to the aft. The hook shot away from him with it's line following. He reached out his hands to brace himself against the side wall of the Burro, took hold of the hook's line.
