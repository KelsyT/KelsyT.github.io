Norman zipped up his yellow jumper, landed feet first into an E.V.A. suit and shut his eyes as he savored one last breath. *72 hours till I get back to this stinking air I seem to love.* As his lungs filled, the suit began to seal along his spine, slicone creeping it's way up until it locked with a tickle at the nape of his neck. *Sometimes the seals didn't want to come undone.* As he continued inhaling, the suit depressed around him, closing in around him. Raising his right hand, he slapped on his air pump. The suit relaxed outward. Norman finally exhaled and opened his eyes.

*I swear these suits are getting heavier. But this damned wardrobe always was too bright.* He brought his hand up to sheild his eyes but the light was too diffused. Alongside him were several other E.V.A. suits strapped to the worn octagonal walls of the crampt cabin. He swang open the door in front and used hand holds to climb through the opening into the airlock. Norman swiped his keycard along the scanner, flicked ol' button labled with a checkmark, and after a short delay, the steel door behind him slammed closed as the airlock began to depressurize. He wedged his boots into the foot rungs and felt his feet squeze against the bottom of his socks. They were already wet with sweat.

The siren began shouting and Norman could feel the pressure on his body lifting away. *Mag's gonna ask where the carriage went again. What am I gonna tell him?* The white chamber lights flickered and then switched to a yellow devoid of warmth. The air seemed to hiss as it scurried away. and the lights turned from white to yellow. The sound of the siren was abruptly sliced, and then there was silence.
