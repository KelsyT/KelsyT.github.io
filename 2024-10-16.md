Norman zipped up his yellow jumper, dove feet first into the EVA suit and closed his eyes as he savored one last deep breath. He wouldn't breathe fresh air for 72 hours. As he stood, filling his lungs, the opening along his spine began to seal automatically, creeping it's way up his spine and locking with a tickle at the nape of his neck. The heavy suit weighed down on him like a boulder as his breath continued, then raising his right hand, he slapped on his air pump. His suit relaxed outward. Norman finally exhaled and opened his eyes.

He was blinded by the flourecence radiating off the worn octagonal walls of the wardrobe. Several other EVA suits were left strapped in place beside him. He swang open the door in front and used hand holds to climb through the opening into the airlock. Norman swiped his keycard along the scanner and after a short delay, the steel door behind him slammed closed and the airlock began to depressurize. He wedged his boots into the foot rungs and felt his feet squeze against the bottom of his socks. They were already wet with sweat.

A siren began shouting and Norman could feel the pressure on his body lifting away. Relief came, and then he felt a wave of vertigo mixed with dread. The white chamber lights flickered and then switched to a yellow devoid of warmth. The air seemed to hiss as it scurried away. and the lights turned from white to yellow. The sound of the siren was abruptly sliced, and then there was silence.
