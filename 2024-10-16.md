Norman zipped up his yellow jumper, dove feet first into the EVA suit and closed his eyes as he savored one last deep breath. He wouldn't breathe fresh air for 72 hours. As he stood, filling his lungs, the opening along his spine began to seal automatically, creeping it's way up his spine and locking with a tickle at the nape of his neck. His suit began to give in as his breath continued, then raising his right hand, he slapped on his air pump. His suit relaxed outward. Norman finally exhaled and opened his eyes.

He stood in a small, octagnoal cabin lined with worn white walls. Several other empty EVA suits were left strapped to the wall beside him. In front sat the square entry to the air lock. He pushed a square button with an embossed checkmark in its center, and the door swang open. Norman used the handclimbed over the high threshold through the opening the door left.
