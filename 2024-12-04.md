After listening to Jordan Peterson and Alex O'Connell

Evolution by natural selection describes the force of an environment that selects for genetic traits that help an organism *survive* in said environment.

If the human brain is a result of said evolution, then it is a mind developed for survival. Is survival at odds with truth? Alex asks if our brains are good at surviving, does that mean that they aren't good at figuring out the truth? Dawkins counters the point be saying that the truth helps mankind survive. But could it be that evolution, the force selecting for survival in fact undermines our ability to reason and find the truth?

There is such a concept of negativity-bias. For example, when we hear a rusting sound in the bushes we think it's a lion, not a kitten
