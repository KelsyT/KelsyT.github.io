After listening to Jordan Peterson and Alex O'Connell

Evolution by natural selection describes the force of an environment that selects for genetic traits that help an organism *survive* in said environment.

If the human brain is a result of said evolution, then it is a mind developed for survival. Is survival at odds with truth? Alex asks if our brains are good at surviving, does that mean that they aren't good at figuring out the truth? Dawkins counters the point be saying that the truth helps mankind survive. But could it be that evolution, the force selecting for survival in fact undermines our ability to reason and find the truth?

There is such a concept of negativity-bias. For example, when we hear a rusting sound in the bushes, we think it's a lion, not a kitten. I need to look into negativity-bias, I'm just BSing here. Though my cousin Kyle often would remind me the humans remember the things that cause them pain before the things that bring them joy. This line of reasoning is supported by the idea that evolution is selecting for traits of survivability.

As JP and Alex went on, they brought up memes. JP says that memes are the same as Archetypes, something JP often brings up in his discussions. He also said something like Dawkins doesn't know about "Jungian literature theory (not quoted correctly)" and therefore lacks an understanding of religion.

JP says truth and fiction are not opposites. He brings up "hyper-real" things, perhaps those are the memes/archetypes he is talking about. Either way, he argues that fictional characters, or memes themselves exist *more* than himself and Alex do, being mere people. 

I love this idea of memes. 

The discussion reminds me of snow crash, but I've forgotten the details of memes in that book. Regardless, Neal Stephenson writes about the power that "mind viruses" have, or memes. Mind you, this is a book written in the 90's that reads way ahead of it's time, or at least I thought it held out well. 

Memes existing more than people is very powerful, and something I intuitively consider on a daily basis. It's funny how memes can be broken down to such things as digital gif's shared on the internet, all the way to biblical proportions, wreaking havoc by the sharp end of a sword from crusaders to many and transcendence to divine inspiration for some.

Memes are the genetic material that continue to persist within all things, living or dead. I should probably read Dawkins books on the subject since it fascinates me so much. But either way, memes are how we describe all the things that persist across lifetimes, centuries, galaxies perhaps. So when a man decides he wants to plant some seeds for the future, to bring shade and fruit to the next generation, what shall he consider
