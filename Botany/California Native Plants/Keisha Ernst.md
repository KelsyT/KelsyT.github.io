I wear many hats but my main focus is on fostering a community around microbe farming. I have a passion for helping the unseen lives in the soil come into view through images and videos taken with a microscope. Check out the **[My Microbes website](https://www.mymicrobes.org/)** to see some of my projects, or visit Soil Microbe Library on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soilmicrobelibrary/)** and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/adventurewithmicroscopes) to see my videos and images.

**I enjoy consulting at Catalyst BioLogical solutions, an on-site service developed around creating and maintaining soil fertility.**

I’m a founding member of the **[Sierra Soil Biology Association](https://sierrasoilbiologyassociation.com/).** It’s a non-profit organization of biology-focused people. We’ve got soil food web consultants, lab techs, and community influencers, all of whom promote the regeneration of soil. We aim to raise the quality of food by increasing microbial biomass in agricultural soils.
