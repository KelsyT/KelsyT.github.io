Scottish botanist Davis Douglas and German physician Johann von Eschscholz are two prominent examples of collection expeditions to the Pacific Northwest and California in the early 1800's. 1753's *[[Species Planetarium|Species Planetarium]]* (translated to "The Species of Plants") by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus was the first work that consistently used [[Binomial Nomenclature|binomial nomenclature]] (Genus + species) for plants, which is the basis for modern taxonomy.

The gold rush of the west 1847-48 led to a large population growth and eventual application for statehood. This led to further expeditions such as botanists Alice Eastwood and Willis Linn Jepson funded by the newly established institutions of California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, and the University of California, Berkley. Their goal was to catalog the flora of California.

Julie defines "discovering" as finding a [[Population|population]] or populations of plants that don't fit the description of any named plants in catalogs such as *JEPS eFlora*, the *Flora of North America*, the *Oregon Flora*, the *Intermountain Flora*, or any other pertinent published flora. Julie notes the possibility that your weirdo plant has been previously published but is not recognized in any of the current Floras. "Naming" is naming a plant according to the rules of International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, which is updated by the International Association of Plant Taxonomists every few years.

Specialists in a particular plant group: [[Taxonomists|taxonomists]] and [[Systematists|systematists]]. Experts in a particular regional flora: floristians. 

Julie refers to the early explorers as "hay balers" as their primary duty was to find new plant with little regard for detailed note taking. With so many new plants to discover, they focused more on shipped as many plants back home as they could.
