**Hydrozoning** is the practice of clustering together plants with similar water requirements in an effort to conserve water.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoning#cite_note-1) Grouping plants into hydrozones is an approach to [irrigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation "Irrigation") and [garden design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_design "Garden design") where plants with similar water needs are grouped together. Through the practice of hydrozoning, it is possible to customize irrigation schedules for each area’s needs, improving efficiency and avoiding overwatering and underwatering certain plants and grasses.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoning#cite_note-2)
