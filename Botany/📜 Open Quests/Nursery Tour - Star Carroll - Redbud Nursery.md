9/14/2024 I met Star Carroll at a community  ***Star told me she would give me a private "nickel" tour of the [[CNPS Redbud Chapter]] propagation nursey.***

9/15/2024 I met up with [[Star Carroll]] at the CNPS Redbud nursery. I took photos, video and recording audio of Star while she gave me a tour of the nursery. She showed me a lot of different plants that I was too overwhelmed to fully appreciate but It was so nice seeing a community effort to grow and sell the placer and nevada county regions natives. She is quite an enthusiast and self learner. She refers to herself as the "Garden Grandma", though she told me that the nursery is ran by volunteers like herself. A married couple manage the nursery, Nancy Gilbert who has an extensive knowledge of plants and landscaping, as well as her husband Ames, who provides engineer/infrastructure support for the nursery. It's a scrappy yet clean and orgainzed place.

I offered to volunteer at this nursery and anywhere else I could lend a hand. Star told me she would put in me into contact with [[Chris Catlin]] who manages the volunteers for the nursery.
