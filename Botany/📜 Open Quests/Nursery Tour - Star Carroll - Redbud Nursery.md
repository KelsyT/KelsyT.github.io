***Star told me she would give me a private "nickel" tour of the [[CNPS Redbud Chapter]] propagation nursey.***

9/15/2024 I met up with Star at the CNPS Redbud nursery. I took photos, video and recording audio of Star while she gave me a tour of the nursery. She showed me a lot of different plants that I was too overwhelmed to fully appreciate but It was so nice seeing a community effort to grow and sell our regions natives
