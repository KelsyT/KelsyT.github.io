blurb about myself

why i want to farm

availability



What hours are you looking to fill?


Hello Diane,

I'm Kelsy T. Sparling, it's nice to meet you. I'm from Auburn, born and raised. 

I'd like to answer some of your questions and ask a few myself. 

How much are you offering for this position? 

I'm available to work any day of the week, though I plan on taking classes in the fall of 2025 and will need to reduce my hours at that point. I'm open to working weekends too, but that will also depend on my wife.

My day job is all-consuming and I need some sunlight. I feel my body atrophy and know that I need to use it before it grows weak. I was most fit working with my cousin Kyle doing construction, spending my days hauling loads of material back and forth.

I've steadily become more and more interested in agriculture over the years. As you know my wife has farmed before so I got a taste of what that life entails at Michael and Shannon's farm. I care about where my food comes from, it's nutritional value, and the practices that result in it's growth. I've recently began volunteering at the California Native Plant Society Redbud chapter nursery in Grass Valley to reconnect with plants and learn what I can from the wise sages that run the place. I've made some friends there an cherish the experience I get to partake in with them.

I've also been interviewing a professional soil scientist in order to grasp the world under our feet and am currently reading "Teaming with microbes" by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis. I am motivated by opportunities to learn
