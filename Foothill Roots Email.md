blurb about myself

why i want to farm

availability



What hours are you looking to fill?


Hello Diane,

I'm Kelsy T. Sparling, it's nice to meet you. I'm from Auburn, born and raised. 

I'd like to answer some of your questions and ask a few myself. 

How much are you offering for this position? 

I'm available to work any day of the week, though I plan on taking classes in the fall of 2025 and will need to reduce my hours at that point. I'm open to working weekends too, but that will also depend on my wife.

I've steadily become more and more interested in agriculture over the years. As you know my wife has farmed before so I got a taste of what that life entails at Michael and Shannon's farm. I care about where my food comes from, it's nutritional value, and the practices that result in it's  growth
