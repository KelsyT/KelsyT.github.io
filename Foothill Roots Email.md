Hello Diane,

I'll start with the blurb about myself! 

**About me**

I'm Kelsy T. Sparling, and I'm from Auburn, born and raised. I've always been attracted to technology, only finding interest in plants much later in my life. I can thank my wife Ashcat for contributing to that.

My current job is challenging, which I appreciate, but it's also disconnected from what I feel is becoming important in my life. That's sunlight, using my body, connecting with the natural world and the food that I eat. I'm also obsessed with systems and optimization, though I imagine I won't be managing the farm any time soon! 

**Why farming?**

I've steadily become more and more interested in agriculture over the years. As you know my wife has farmed before so I got a taste of what that life entails at Michael and Shannon's farm. I care about where my food comes from, it's nutritional value, and the practices that result in it's growth. I've recently began volunteering at the California Native Plant Society Redbud chapter nursery in Grass Valley to reconnect with plants and learn what I can from the wise sages that run the place. I've made some friends there an cherish the experience I get to partake in with them.

I've also been interviewing a professional soil scientist in order to better grasp the world under our feet and am currently reading "Teaming with microbes" by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis. As I'll mention below, I'm going to go back to college in the fall of 2025, and my intention is to get a degree in microbiology. I'm deeply motivated by opportunities to learn and practice new skills.

**Answering your questions**

I've attached the resume like you've asked. My availability is any day of the week, though I plan on enrolling into college in the fall of 2025 and will need to reduce my hours at that point, ideally working weekends if possible, but will remain flexible.

**My questions**

How much are you offering for this position? What hours are you looking to fill?

I hope I do get to do a working interview, but if not, I look forward to coming to the farm stand soon for some fresh veggies.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Kelsy
