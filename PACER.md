**Prodecual**: the steps to take in order to practive a skill.
	Practice immediatle.

**Analogous**: Forming connections between new information and previous understanding.
	Critique the anology, trying to find where it succeeds to connect ideas, and where it fails, and if there are better analogies.

**Coneceptual**: Facts, explanations, theories, principles, applications.
	Use mind maps to recreate the experts understanding by making connections between conecpts, facts, evidence and other info. Finding how these relate and flow to form a bigger picture, and practice moving through each concept non-linearly.

**Evidence**: Recorded facts of when a given conecpt has occurred, and what happened. Used to prove a conceptual point.
	Store and rehearse. How to use and apply information. Identifying which type of conceptual info it is an example of.
	
**Reference**: Specific information that doesnt change conceptual understanding.
