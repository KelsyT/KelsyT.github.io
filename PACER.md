**Conceptual**: Facts, explanations, theories, principles, applications.
	Use mind maps to recreate the experts understanding by making connections between concepts, facts, evidence and other info. Finding how these relate and flow to form a bigger picture, and practice moving through each concept non-linearly.

	Store and rehearse. How to use and apply information. Identifying which type of conceptual info it is an example of.
	
**Reference**: Specific information that doesn't change conceptual understanding.
	Store and rehearse. For reference info, using flashcards repeatedly is the best way to rehearse.
