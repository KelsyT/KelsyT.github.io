Hi, I'm Kelsy and this is my website's readme! It's hosted on GitHub Pages and I'm using the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

The intention here is to provide a place for my digital garden outside of social media, something that I own and control like the old web.

I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write and edit, I recommend it as an easy to use application for note taking and general idea organizing. I like it especially because it uses markdown files which can link together. This feature can help link ideas and create a web that's perfect for a website but also has a lot of use to a writer to tie different ideas together. 



It also displays an interactive graph view of all your notes/links.
