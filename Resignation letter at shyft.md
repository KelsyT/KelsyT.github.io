Electronics Technician Manager
Shyft Global Services / TD SYNNEX

Dear Jas,

I'm writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as Electronics Technician II at Shyft Global Services / TD SYNNEX, effective February 21st, 2025. This letter serves as my two weeks' notice of resignation.

Thank you for the opportunities for professional growth you've helped provide me since our interview in 2022. I've gained a lot of experience working with the team here at Shyft and the skills will be invaluable to the rest of my career.

I'm committed to ensuring a smooth transition of my responsibilities before my last day. I'll help to prepare the team with updates to any pending projects and share helpful documents I've used. Please let me know how I can best assist in transferring my duties to other team members.

Thank you for your understanding and support during my time at Shyft Global Services. I wish you and the team nothing but success in the future.

Sincerely,



Kelsy Sparling
