Preface

The industry of horticulture, with it supplies, advice and products is show to be antithetical to a plants health. This is due to soil being overlooked in the gardener's eye, instead being encouraged to focus on spraying the weeds, renting the roto-tiller, and fertilizing after the last frost. All prescriptions of items designed by people to solve the problems of plants, packaged with easy to follow instructions.

An integral notion of the gardening world is proposed: nitrogen from organic sources is the same as nitrogen from inorganic sources.

Scanning Electron Microscope images highlight a root-feeding nematode trapped within the rings of a fungal hypha. Another image shows a nematode entering the root wall of a tomato plant. 

Consilience of microbiology, bacteriology, mycology, myrmecology, chemistry, agriculture has led to discoveries in soil science that are being applied to commercial agriculture, silviculture and viniculture.

The preface is concluded with the promise that, if the soil food web is nurtured, your plants will grow more easily and become more healthy.
