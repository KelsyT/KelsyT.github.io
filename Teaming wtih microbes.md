Preface

The industry of horticulture, with it supplies, advice and products is show to be antithetical to a plants health. This is due to soil being overlooked in the gardener's eye, instead being encouraged to focus on spraying the weeds, renting the roto-tiller, and fertilizing after the last frost. All prescriptions of store bought packaged items designed by people to solve the problems of plants.

An assumption of the gardening world is proposed: nitrogen from organic sources is the same as nitrogen from inorganic sources.

Scanning Electron Microscope images highlight a root-feeding nematode trapped within the rings of a fungal hypha. Another image shows a nematode entering the root wall of a tomato plant.
