Where does cancer start?

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6721418/

It starts life as a cell, of course! It divides from one of your cells, could be any cell in your body. Or anyones body. Or anythings body. It grows on microscopic cells, it grows on bacteria(?) But regardless of what kind of cell it orginated from, it is itself, in fact, just another cell.

In mediciene, doctors keep cancer cells alive, in what are called "lines", as in, production lines. Like a factory, only growing cells. Cancer cells are a convient form of life to study, as they grow indefinetly. The programmed death of a cell is called Apoptosis, and cancer evades it well.
