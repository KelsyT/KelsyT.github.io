Hi fellow stackers,

I'm Kelsy, and I'm new to this particular stack. I first found this place after listening to _Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto_ by David Kushner on Audible. I didn't stay long though, never downloaded the app. I just read a few emails from David, and eventually Substack drifted away until I found another writer by the name of Elle Griffin. I occasionally read her emails, which often prompted me to subscribe. I never did. I just happily read her emails and enjoyed whatever free writing she sent my way. Years went by, I got a new phone and I finally found myself downloading Substack.

Immediately this place seemed a lot healthier than other places I've seen, like Instagram and Twitter/X. It seems, according to Substack's official messages, that with over 4 million paid subscribers, this app has cultivated an audience that supports writers. I love that.

Obviously the world of writing and reading is changing. Print is going out of, well, print, and people, such as myself, are mostly using our phones to ingest what others are sharing. Work is where I use my phone the most, which is still rather little, as mostly a passive activity. That’s because I’m listening to people. not actually reading. And boy, some of you can really brighten my day when I hear what come out those noggins.

This brings me to the question: why don’t more of you use the voiceover feature here on Substack? And I'm not talking about the AI voice. We’ll get to that later.

I love listening to inspired people such as yourselves. I love hearing your voices, your thoughts, ideas, stories. The tradition of oral storytelling predates literature, and maybe that’s where I’m getting hung up. Maybe you don’t want to speak, maybe you just want to write. I can accept that. But I would still ask, if you can speak, and if you write posts here on Substack, will you try a voiceover?

I know plenty of the established writers here already use voiceovers. Elle Griffin is one of them, and she puts hers behind a paywall. I can accept that for paid posts. But for free posts, I think the voiceover should be free too. Because if you’re like me, you’re not listening to a voiceover _and_ reading a post, you’re doing one or the other. And if you get me hooked on your free posts, I think I’m more likely to subscribe for your paid posts.

Of course it also takes additional time to record a voiceover. Maybe it’s too loud where you write. You might even think it takes an expensive microphone. But I still urge you to try. I urge you because it likely will be the only way I experience your work. If I continue to press that play button above posts, and I continue to hear that sad AI read your thoughtful writing, I will probably give up and switch to another app where audio is prioritized. That's not a threat, it's a plea for you to bring your voice to my ear.

If Substack had a filter for posts that have recorded voiceovers, I'd hit autoplay on that and listen through my whole work shift. I love hearing the author read their posts. And I'd probably be more likely to subscribe being able to hear you speak. The human voice connects us to one another. It brings warmth and emotional depth.

I hope to hear you soon. Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

Kelsy

So, pros and cons:

Pros:

- Brings in an audience who may never be able to read your work
    
- Adds the warmth and expression of your voice to your words
    

Cons:

- Time-consuming
    
- Costs of equipment
    
- Lacks SEO indexing?

The reason I care about this brings me back to how little I'm able to read what you have to say most of the time I'm going to be on my phone. Once I get home, I don't want to be on any social media. Granted, that could change if my job was different. I am currently writing this at home, but that's _writing, not reading._ If I'm at home and I'm reading, I'm more likely to read a paper book you've published, or much more likely, one of the thousands of other books on my list.

I’m extremely grateful and appreciative of the effort and act of writing. I couldn’t come up with all this on the spot in the hopefully somewhat cohesive manor this post is in now. But the act of writing doesn’t have to be the end. It can of course be a jumping off point to many other kinds of creation. For me, the spoken word read aloud is a beautiful form of human expression.

if you share a free post, why not add in a voiceover too? I see some writers neglect to do so here, instead opting for the AI voiceover.

Granted, I know it will only get better, but as it stands, it's pretty uncanny and off-putting.

Perhaps the AI voice is good for accessibility to those who need it from authors who will not make voiceovers. I acknowledge that.

You may think I'm a special case, but I think I represent a lot of people that will join this community.

I'd rather listen to you than AI that gives me the creeps.

And don't tell me that you don't like the sound of your voice. I promise you with time that can change. We're talking exposure therapy here, no matter how awful it may seem, eventually you will be able to speak into a microphone and play it back without cringing... the whole time. Seriously though, the importance of your voice can't be understated. To some degree, it's what makes you a human here. I invite all of you who don't think that your audience will enjoy listening to you to try a voiceover. You may be surprised by how much people love it.

Substack seems to be all about the writing, which is fantastic since most other places online push video now. But it must be said that most people *listen* to books as opposed to *reading*. I too listen more than I read.

I find reading text from the screen of my phone to be off putting. I’d much rather listen if given the option, and if given the option to listen to the authors voice, I’ll gladly choose that over any AI. Ok, maybe there could be a case to be made for using AI for some voices, such as RFK Jr., but I digress.

Another reason an author may not want to record a narration of their post could be because they lack the equipment in order to do so. But I’d happily listen to someone use their phone’s microphone than an AI. There’s a lot of emotion that can be expressed with the voice, and I love that dimension of listening to the spoken word.

That’s it, thanks for your time.
