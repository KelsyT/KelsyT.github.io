Hi fellow stackers,

I'm Kelsy, and I'm new to this particular stack. I first found this place after listening to _Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto_ by Daivd Kushner on Audible. I didn't stay long though, never downloaded the app. I just read a few emails from David, and eventually Substack drifted away until I found another writer by the name of Elle Griffin. I ocasionally read her emails, which often promtped me for a subscription to her on Substack. I never did. I just happily read her emails and enjoyed whatever free writing she sent my way. Years went by, I got a new phone and I finally found myself downloading Substack.

Immediatly this place seemed a lot healthier than other places I've seen, like Instagram and Twitter/X. It seems, according to Substack's offical messages, that with over 4 million paid subscribers, this app has cultivated an audience that supports writers. I love that. 

Obvisouly the world of writing and reading is changing. Print is going out of, well, print, and people, such as myself, are consuming content digitally on a device that sits our pockets most of the day. Most of the time I'm using my phone I'm at work. I can't read at work, but I love listening to people at work. It can really brighten my day and boost my mood when I hear your perspectives, stories and ideas.

This brings me to the question: why don’t more of you use the voiceover feature here on substack? And I'm not talking about the automated AI voice. Granted, I know it will only get better, but as it stands, it's pretty uncanny and offputting. 

Perhaps the AI voice is good for accesiblity to those who need it from authors who will not make voiceovers. I acknowldge that. 

But for most of you, I think it's a waste not to use this feature, even if it's on posts without a paywall. I see Elle Graiffen puts the voiceover behind a paywall for some posts, but for the truly free posts she uses the AI voice.

The reason I care about this 

I suppose some form of audio is better than none, but the quality of the current sub stack AI voice is poor.

I wish sub stack had a filter for posts that have real recorded voice for the audio. I love hearing the author read their posts. Some dislike audiobooks that are narrated but the author, which may be fair (unless we’re discussing Stephen Fry), but I enjoy hearing the voice behind the author. 

Substack seems to be all about the writing, which is fantastic since most other places online push video now. But it must be said that most people *listen* to books as opposed to *reading*. I too listen more than I read. 

I find reading text from the screen of my phone to be off putting. I’d much rather listen if given the option, and if given the option to listen to the authors voice, I’ll gladly choose that over any AI. Ok, maybe there could be a case to be made for usingAI for some voices, such as RFK Jr., but I digress. 

Another reason an author may not want to record a narration of their post could be because they lack the equipment in order to do so. But I’d happily listen to someone use their phone’s microphone than an AI. There’s a lot of emotion that can be expressed with the voice, and I love that dimension of listening to the spoken word. 

That’s it, thanks for your time.
