Hi fellow stackers,

I'm Kelsy, and I'm new to this particular stack. I first found this place after listening to _Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto_ by Daivd Kushner on Audible. I didn't stay long though, never downloaded the app. I just read a few emails from David, and eventually Substack drifted away until I found another writer by the name of Elle Griffin. I ocasionally read her emails, which often promtped me for a subscription to her on Substack. I never did. I just happily read her emails and enjoyed whatever free writing she sent my way. Years went by, I got a new phone and I finally found myself downloading Substack.

Immediatly this place seemed a lot healthier than other places I've seen, like Instagram and Twitter/X. It seems, according to Substack's offical messages, that with over 4 million paid subscribers, this app has cultivated an audience that supports writers. I love that. 

Obvisouly the world of writing and reading is changing. Print is going out of, well, print, and people, such as myself, are consuming content digitally on a device that sits our pockets most of the day. Most of the time I'm using my phone I'm at work. I can't read at work, but I love listening to people at work. It can really brighten my day and boost my mood when I hear your perspectives, stories and ideas.

This brings me to the question: why don’t more of you use the voiceover feature here on substack? And I'm not talking about the automated AI voice. Granted, I know it will only get better, but as it stands, it's pretty uncanny and offputting. 

Perhaps the AI voice is good for accesiblity to those who need it from authors who will not make voiceovers. I acknowldge that. 

But for most of you, I think it's a waste not to use this feature, even if it's on posts without a paywall. I see Elle Graiffen puts the voiceover behind a paywall for some posts, but for the truly free posts she uses the AI voice.

The reason I care about this brings me back to how little I'm able to read what you have to say most of the time I'm going to be on my phone. Once I get home, I don't want to be on any social media. Granted, that could change if my job was different. I am currently writing this at home, but that's _writing, not reading._ If I'm at home and I'm reading, I'm more likley to read a paper book you've published, or much more likely, one of the thousands of other books on my list.

You may think I'm a special case, but I think I represent a lot of people that will join this community.

I'd rather listen to you than AI that gives me the creeps. 

And don't tell me that you don't like the sound of your voice. I promise you with time that can change. We're talking expsoure therapy here, no matter how awful it may seem, eventually you will be able to speak into a microphone and play it back without cringing... the whole time. Serisouly though, the importance of your voice can't be understated. To some degree, it's what makes you a human here. I invite all of you who don't think that your audience will enjoy listening to you to try a voiceover. You may be surprised by how much people love it.

And that's no surprise, since more people are listening to books than buying them these days. I've heard of romace authors writing books every couple of months, recording an audio book and then either using Audible or Youtube to make a decent amount of money. That's just annocedotle though. 

And this matters becuase it determines whether or not I continue to engage with Substack. If I continue to press that play button aobve posts, and I continue to hear that sad AI read your thoughtfully written post and then back out before either trying to find another post or just going back a podcast or YouTube, I may eventuall stop using Substack all together. That's not a threat, it's a plea for you to being your voice to my ear.

If Substack had a filter for posts that have recorded voiceovers, I'd hit autoplay on that and listen through my whole work shift. I love hearing the author read their posts. And I'd probably be more likley to subscribe being able to hear you speak. The human voice connects us to one another. It brings warmth and emotional depth. 

I'm sure many of you already understand the power the our voices bring to our writing. 

Substack seems to be all about the writing, which is fantastic since most other places online push video now. But it must be said that most people *listen* to books as opposed to *reading*. I too listen more than I read. 

I find reading text from the screen of my phone to be off putting. I’d much rather listen if given the option, and if given the option to listen to the authors voice, I’ll gladly choose that over any AI. Ok, maybe there could be a case to be made for usingAI for some voices, such as RFK Jr., but I digress. 

Another reason an author may not want to record a narration of their post could be because they lack the equipment in order to do so. But I’d happily listen to someone use their phone’s microphone than an AI. There’s a lot of emotion that can be expressed with the voice, and I love that dimension of listening to the spoken word. 

That’s it, thanks for your time.
