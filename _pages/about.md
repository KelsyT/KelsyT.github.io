👋 Hi, I'm Kelsy. When I'm not contentedly arguing with everyone within an arm's reach you'll find me playing games, taking photos, repairing computers, petting cats and cooking. This website will hold my brain (thought-katamari) together with the intention of exploring ideas and building knowledge.

That's the about page for now. Thanks for being here.
