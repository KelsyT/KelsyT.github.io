ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kelsy.  I play games, take photos, repair computers, pet cats and cook. This website is all about creating a place for my writing. Here I will organize my thoughts and build my knowledge. I think it's important to write things down so you're not holding everything in your head. Especially since I forget easily. Writing also helps me build understanding and meaning through my life. So yep, that's the about page for now. Thanks for being here.
