Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my desire for the Soil Technician/Field Representative position at ENGEO. My brother put me into contact with Nick Broussard who referred me to ENGEO, and my background in construction and technical testing has given me a strong foundation for the position you're offering.

My experience in construction includes hands-on work with site preparation and foundation construction that aligns directly with ENGEO's field representation needs. Working under a licensed contractor (Kyle Letcher #1100077), I performed manual grading, constructed concrete forms to specification using measuring lines, and installed gravel fill and rebar grids for foundations. This experience has given me practical knowledge of California building codes and a thorough understanding of the importance of precise measurements and quality control in construction.

In my current position as an Electronics Technician II at Shyft Global Services, I have developed robust technical and analytical skills. I troubleshoot complex systems using both visual inspections and diagnostic tools, analyze error logs to identify root causes, and document findings clearly for our customer in the semiconductor industry. I've also improved our quality control processes by developing new Standard Operating Procedures and creating automated tracking systems using Excel macros, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement and efficiency.

ENGEO stands out to me due to your commitment to employee development through mentorship and cross-training opportunities. In my current role, I have reached a ceiling in terms of professional growth, and I'm eager to join an organization that actively invests in its employees' development. Your approach to supporting additional certifications and providing paths for advancement strongly aligns with my desire to grow and build the value I can provide others.

Recently I've been interviewing a soil microbiologist named Wesley Sanders in my free time to nourish my understanding of plants as a volunteer of the California Native Plant Society. He's shown me how to take soil samples and identify the microbes under a microscope in his lab. While this isn't directly applicable to the role at ENGEO, I wanted to mention it to display my desire to learn and practice scientific methods. 

My combination of construction experience and technical expertise provides a strong foundation for this role. I understand the critical importance of precise measurements and detailed documentation in construction, and I am eager to apply these skills in a new context. I am prepared to complete all necessary certifications, including the Nuclear Density Gauge certification, and am particularly interested in pursuing additional Special Inspections qualifications through your cross-training program.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to discussing how my background and enthusiasm for professional growth align with ENGEO's needs.

Sincerely,
Kelsy Sparling
