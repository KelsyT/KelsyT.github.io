#### How we talk about games matters

What games do you *enjoy* playing?
What games do you find *compelling*?

What was the intent of the developers?
What is the Gesamtkunstwerk of the game?
And did the developers undermine the Gesamtkunstwerk of their game?
What string of intention can be found tying the game together?


#### Extrinsic motivators

methods of motivation

extrinsic motivation
- random loot drops in fun chests
	- I still like these kinds of motivators but only when they take a back seat

motivation by statistical progression in RPG's 
- statistical progression through increasing attributes
	- these can be a turn off if shoved in my face
- feeling of lack of investment in main character due to lack of influence in story
- I feel like I'm not a true fan of ARPG's despite my experience with them, and thus lack good faith, or at least it feels that way when reading this as it just kind of ends with me saying get XP noties out my face. I'm trying to express the fact that XP noties don't motivate me, but it doesn't feel good.
- Then I argue about RPG's, and why they too shouldn't have XP noties.
- I argue that MMORPG's, along with ARPG's are all about the attributes despite the quality and size of their setting, story and presentation. 
- Truth is these motivators compel some, not me typically. Either way to reduce World of Warcraft to just "It's all about the attributes" is reductive.
