#### How we talk about games matters

What games do you *enjoy* playing?
What games do you find *compelling*?

What was the intent of the developers?
What is the Gesamtkunstwerk of the game?
And did the developers undermine the Gesamtkunstwerk of their game?
What string of intention can be found tying the game together?


#### Extrinsic motivators

methods of motivation

extrinsic motivation
- random loot drops in fun chests
	- I still like these kinds of motivators but only when they take a back seat

Defining APRG's
- statistical progression through increasing attributes
	- these can be a turn off if shoved in my face
- feeling of lack of investment in main character due to lack of influence in story
- I feel like I'm not a true fan of ARPG's despite my experience with them, and thus lack good faith, or at least it feels that way when reading this as it just kind of ends with me saying get XP noties out my face like wtf
